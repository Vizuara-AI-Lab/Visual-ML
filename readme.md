# Visual ML
- We’re building a drag-and-drop ML learning playground where students can visually create end-to-end machine learning workflows:
- **Upload Dataset → Clean Data → Split → Train Model → Evaluate → Share Results → Build Custom UI → Connect Hardware**
- The platform will include **GenAI-powered features** with an integrated **LLM**, allowing users to either **upgrade to advanced models** or **plug in their own API key**.
- To make learning faster, students can start with **ready-made templates**—for example, clicking **Linear Regression** instantly loads all the required nodes and steps for that pipeline.
- We’ll also provide **workflow-style automation** for GenAI tasks, enabling students to generate outputs and run repeated actions with minimal effort.
- Our core differentiators will be:
  - **Custom UI builder for student projects**
  - **Real hardware integration for hands-on learning**
- The platform will include two separate experiences: an **Admin Dashboard** for managing registered users and their data, and a **Student Dashboard** for building, learning, and sharing projects.
- Beyond ML, students will also learn **computational thinking** through block-based logic building, including **conditional statements and decision-making flows**, similar to Scratch-style programming.


Because training inside API request = your server dies.
